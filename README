Hello everyone! This is my first Github'd app. It's a really basic Sinatra/Heroku/Twilio app that can be easily modified for your own calling purposes. The app itself is an automated nurse hotline phone system that enables an end user/customer to input their cell phone number and be connected immediately with a nurse. The app does this by placing an initial call to the end user, plays a quick automated message, then creates a second call to the nurse hotline. When the nurse picks up, the calls are connected. The app also sends a SMS thank you message to the end user along with some related health items they may be interested in. 

For the code to be functional, you'll also need a Twilio account (sign up at http://twilio.com). 

For this code, I assume you enter your Twilio SID and Token credentials into your Heroku config file. 

Hope you enjoy the app!
Tim
